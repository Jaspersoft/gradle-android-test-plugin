gradle-android-command-plugin
=============================

Use gradle tasks to run specific command, such as:

- find all devices attached
- select the first one that complies with a custom rule
- install a specific Apk from the available build types + flavors
- clear preferences or do something related to the apk to prepare for tests
- run monkey runner for that specific apk on that specific device


This is particularly useful for CI servers but could be used to speed up IDE development as well
